Face Detection Demo Application using C++, Cinder and OpenCV CinderBlock
========================================================================

by Giovanni Dicanio


Built using Visual Studio 2012.

Cinder installed under:

  C:\Cinder\cinder_0.8.5_vc2012
  


NOTE:
-----
Since the OpenCV CinderBlock is very big to be uploaded on DropBox,
I've not included it under the "blocks" folder. 
Just create the project using TinderBox as showed in the demo.
All the other parts of the project (source code, assets, etc.) are here.
